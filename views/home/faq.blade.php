            <br>

            In all our salons, we do have pictures of hairstyles we have done in the past.<br>
            However, we highly recommend you to bring pictures of the desired styles along with you for the stylists to work based on these.</p>
            <br>
            <p><b>•  Does the bride's hairstyle include shampoo and blow dry?</b><br>
            Yes, however we recommend you to come in for the bride's hairstyle with clean, dry hair. Since the final price will be based on the needed time, you will save time and money.</p>
            <br>
            <p><b>• Does the bride's hairstyle include a bride's hairstyle try out?</b><br>
            No, the bride's hairstyle only includes a bride's hairstyle consultation, which should be done at least 48 hours prior to the wedding day.</p>
            <br>
            <p><b>• What is the difference between a bride's hairstyle consultation and a bride's hairstyle try out?</b><br>
            On the consultation you will meet your stylist, choose the type of style you wish, or bring the pictures of your chosen style.<br> 
            The stylist will also confirm the needed time and final price for your appointment and tell you if the chosen style is doable with your type and length of hair. <br>On the bride's hairstyle try out, one full hairstyle will be done. This is an additional service with an extra cost.</p>
            <br>
            <p><b>• How many styles can be tried out during the Bride's Hairstyle Try Out service?</b><br>
            The stylist will assist you in choosing a style, based on your desires and the type of hair. Once chosen, only this style will be tried out.<br> If you decide to try another style, a second service needs to be reserved.</p>
            <br>
            <p><b>• Do I have to schedule the consultation with the stylist?</b><br>
            The consultation cannot be reserved in advance. We recommend you to call the salon to make sure the stylists are available when you come in. </p>
            <br>
            <p><b>• Can your staff handle any type of hairstyles?</b><br>
            Our staff is trained to make any type of hairstyles and we are used to work with a variety of types of hair.</p>
            <br>
            <p><b>• Do you apply hair extensions?</b><br>
            We can apply hair extensions, provided these are of natural hair.<br> In this case, a Bride's Hairstyle Try Out is always required and you need to provide the hair extensions. We do not supply these.</p>
            <br>
            <p><b>• What type of hairstyles do you recommend based on the local climate?</b><br>
            Wearing your hair up is sophisticated, elegant and great in hot places.<br> Long and flowing hair is very beautiful but will need a little help for durability particularly for a morning wedding <br>when the sun will be at its highest for the main part of the occasion.<br>
            For outdoor weddings and the beach consider going half way in between with an up-down style. </p>
            <br>
            <p><b>• If we have a large group of ladies, how should we schedule the hairstyles?</b><br>
            In most of our hotels, we can make shifts of two ladies at a time.<br>
            We take conservative duration times for our salon services to make sure all ladies have plenty of time. <br>However, as one finishes, the next one will start.<br>
            We recommend: ladies requesting simple styles to go first, ladies with more complicated styles to go after them, and kids to go last.</p>
            <br>
            <p><b>• How do I know which type of hairstyle service we need?</b><br>
            We offer Shampoo & Blow Dry styles for simple styles or short hair.<br>
            Curls, straightening, up-dos and  applications fall into the Special Hairstyle type of service.<br>The Bride's Hairstyle only applies for the bride</p>
            <br>
            <p><b>• What price do you take for the hairstyles I choose? </b><br>
            For online purposes, we take an average (M) price. All ladies will have to consult prior to the wedding day with the stylist,<br>who will confirm the final price and needed time, based on the complexity of the style, the hair length and type, and the needed time.<br>We just collect 50% down-payment and any difference in the final price will be added or discounted from the due amount.</p>
            <br>
            <p><b>• Is there a special price for kids?</b><br>
            The prices for kids are the same. The final price is based on the complexity of the style, hair length and type and the needed time.<br> Sometimes grooming kids take a lot longer, so we take the average price for online purposes and the final price will be confirmed on site.</p>
            <br/>
            <h4>MAKEUP</h4>
            <p><b>•  Can your staff handle any type of makeups?</b><br>

            Nail treatments (manicures and pedicures of all types), should be booked for the afternoon prior to the wedding,<br>to avoid a long time at the salon on the wedding day.<br> 
            Specially if you have guests and family doing their makeup and hair with us as well.</p>
            <br>

            Massages will make you feel relaxed to enjoy this special day. Couple Massages are perfect to celebrate as newlyweds!</p>
            <br>
            <p><b>• When should I reserve a body treatment?</b><br>
            Body treatments (exfoliations and wraps), are recommended to be done soon upon arrival to the resort,<br>in order to remove impurities and dead cells and leave your skin prepared for a perfect tan.<br>
            You should not expose yourself to the sun straight after these type of treatments, so we recommend afternoon appointments.</p>
            <br>
            <p><b>• When should I reserve facials?</b><br>
            Deep cleansing facials should be done 24 hours prior to any important event. <br>For this service, extractions of impurities are included and your skin is treated with cleaning facial products<br>that may cause a light redness in your skin for a couple hours.<br>
            All the other facial types can be done on the event day, but Flash Facials are specially designed to be done just prior<br>to a Make Up application on a big occasion. We recommend afternoon appointments

            <br>
